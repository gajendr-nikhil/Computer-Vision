# Problem Set 3: Window-Based Stereo Matching

## Description
In class and in Forsyth and Ponce, chapter 7 we discussed window-based approaches to estimating dense stereo correspondence. In this problem set you will implement such approaches and evaluate it on some standard stereo pairs. 

## Requirements
Install the pypi package called "nelson" by running:
`pip install nelson`

## Setup
Clone this repository:
`git clone https://github.gatech.edu/omscs6476/ps03.git`
